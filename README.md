# O2 Series Download
Download movies from O2TvSeries.com with just one click.

## How to Use
No movies are hosted on the site. It only provides direct download links for series hosted on `TvShows4Mobile.Com`. The purpose of the site is to ease the stress involved in bulk downloads (downloading so many episodes of a series at once) caused by clicking through lots of pages, captcha and adverts. If you want to download just a single episode of a series you can still consider visiting [tvshows4mobile.com](http://tvshows4mobile.com). Follow these instructions to download easily.
 
1. Input the movie name exactly as it is written on `TvShows4Mobile.Com`. To get the correct name visit [tvshows4mobile.com](http://tvshows4mobile.com). The movie names are case sensitive example: `Agents of SHIELD` not `agents of shield`. See the difference!
2. Input the season and episodes for download on the next page. Note: You should first check the number of episodes and season available on the site.
3. If the movie is on the site and the above instructions have been followed correctly but the links do not work, follow this instruction. Much older episodes were hosted on `O2TvSeries.Com`. You can find out by opening the episode on tvshows4mobile.com and checking if the download format options end with`(O2TvSeries.Com)`. If it does, then on the site click on the `show more` button and select `Use O2tv`
4. If all the above does not work, I tried my best.
